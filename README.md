# WASM Graphs

The goal for this is to have a lightweight graphing library that can be used in a browser. The library is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, the goal is for it to be relativly small (Compared to other web graphing options) and type safe.

Another plan for this is that each type of graph will be a separate crate. This will allow for a smaller download size for the end user.
